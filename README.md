Here are a few comments regarding changes I'd like to make.

- Can we make the opening picture taller and narrower? You can crop the door frame on the right side of the picture.
- Let's remove the woodworking is a hobby statement. Please keep the "Quality is a way of life".
- Below the statement about future generations add the following line. "Allow yourself to get spoiled by the quality, durability, and beauty of real wood furniture and furnishings".

I will be sending you a ton of pictures about this church project. I would like to feature that in a "current project" section. These other sets of picutres could be in a gallery section.

I plan to get you some brief descriptions of what is shown in these photos very soon.

Thank you for the help.
